# ACA - Alan's Car Assessor
This program will provide(guess) an assessment price of your vehicle by comparing your vehicle with the similar cars in trademe.nz.
So, please fill in the form and press "Start" button.
If no similar data was found, then there will be an error message on the page.
Since this application has not been approved by trademe.nz yet, please check the program with the tmsandbox.nz.

Usage:
1. Unzip
2. npm install
3. npm start
4. browse http://localhost:3000

Current issues:
1. Layouts are not good. Maybe I will change it in the future.
2. Not test with production data with trademe.nz, I'm waiting for their approvement.
3. The assessment algorithm is stupid. Maybe I could think of a sophisticated method.
4. OAuth keys should be placed in a safe place in the future.
